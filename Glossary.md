## Context
Here we have words, acronyms and jargon to be known by all the team.
They include security related topics and concepts which maybe aren't inside the engineering are of knowledge.

## Concepts

1. **APT (Advanced Persistent Threat):** A type of cyber-attack that is characterized by its persistence, stealth and sophistication.
2. **BYOD (Bring Your Own Device):** A trend in which employees use their personal devices, such as smartphones and laptops, for work purposes.
3. **CASB (Cloud Access Security Broker):** A security solution that provides visibility and control over cloud applications and services.
4. **CISO (Chief Information Security Officer):** An executive-level position responsible for overseeing an organization's cybersecurity strategy and operations.
5. **Cybersecurity:** The practice of protecting devices, networks, and sensitive information from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.
6. **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service):** A type of cyber-attack that floods a network with traffic to overwhelm it and make it unavailable to legitimate users.
7. **DLP (Data Loss Prevention):** A security strategy that detects and prevents the unauthorized movement of sensitive data.
8. **EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response):** A security solution that provides visibility and protection for endpoint devices, such as laptops and mobile devices, by detecting and responding to security threats on those devices.
9. **Endpoint Security:** A security strategy that provides protection for endpoint devices, such as laptops and mobile devices, by detecting and responding to security threats on those devices.
10. **Exploits:** Techniques or tools used by attackers to take advantage of vulnerabilities in a system or network.
11. **IAM (Identity and Access Management):** A security strategy that controls and monitors access to systems and data by managing the identities of users and their associated access controls.
12. **IDS (Intrusion Detection System):** A system that monitors network traffic and analyzes it for signs of malicious activity.
13. **IPS (Intrusion Prevention System):** A system that blocks potential threats in real-time by analyzing network traffic and identifying malicious patterns.
14. **MDR (Managed Detection and Response):** A service that provides continuous monitoring and threat detection, as well as incident response and remediation.
15. **NGAV (Next-Generation Anti-Virus):** A new generation of antivirus software that uses advanced techniques, such as machine learning, to detect and respond to cyber threats.
16. **NOC (Network Operations Center):** A centralized unit that monitors and manages the performance of a network infrastructure and provides technical support.
17. **PAM (Privileged Access Management):** A security strategy that controls and monitors access to sensitive systems and data by privileged users, such as system administrators.
18. **Phishing:** A technique of tricking people into providing sensitive information, such as login credentials, by disguising as a trustworthy entity through email, phone or text message.
19. **Ransomware:** Malware that encrypts a victim's files and demands a ransom payment in exchange for the decryption key.
20. **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management):** A security management system that aggregates and correlates log data from multiple sources in real-time to identify and respond to security threats.
21. **SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response):** A platform that automates incident response and security operations tasks, such as incident triage, threat hunting, and vulnerability management.
22. **SOC (Security Operations Center):** A centralized unit that deals with the detection, investigation and response to cybersecurity threats.
23. **SaaS (Software as a Service):** A model of delivering software applications over the internet, on a subscription basis.
24. **UBA (User Behavior Analytics):** A security technique that uses data science to identify and detect anomalies in user behavior to detect threats.
25. **UEBA (User and Entity Behavioral Analytics):** A security technique that uses data science to identify and detect anomalies in user and entities behavior to detect threats.
26. **Vulnerabilities:** Weakness or gap in the security of a system or network that can be exploited by an attacker.
27. **Zero Trust:** A security strategy that assumes that all network traffic and requests are untrusted and must be verified before granting access.
