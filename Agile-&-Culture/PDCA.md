# PDCA Cycle

> **TL;DR:** PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) is a four-step iterative method for continuous improvement. Plan the change, execute it, measure the results, and standardize or adjust accordingly.

## Overview

The PDCA cycle, also known as the Deming Cycle or Shewhart Cycle, is a systematic framework for problem-solving and continuous improvement. It is designed to be applied iteratively -- not as a one-time event -- until the desired outcome is consistently achieved.

## The Four Steps

1. **Plan:** Identify and define the problem, set goals and objectives, gather and analyze data, and develop a plan to achieve the desired improvement.
2. **Do:** Execute the plan and implement the proposed changes in a controlled manner.
3. **Check:** Measure and monitor the results of the implementation. Compare outcomes against the goals and objectives established during the planning phase.
4. **Act:** Based on the results, determine whether the plan succeeded. If the outcome is satisfactory, standardize the process and continue. If not, revise the approach and repeat the cycle.

## PDCA in Agile

The PDCA cycle aligns naturally with Agile practices. Sprint planning maps to **Plan**, sprint execution to **Do**, sprint review to **Check**, and retrospectives to **Act**. This alignment reinforces the team's commitment to iterative improvement at every level of the development process.
