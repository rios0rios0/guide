# Onboarding

> **TL;DR:** New team members must obtain access to all required platforms, enable 2FA on every account, and configure their development environment using the [Tools & Setup](Cookbooks/Tools-&-Setup.md) guide.

Welcome aboard! This document serves as a starting guide for any engineering team member. It walks you through every step needed to begin contributing to our projects.

**Follow the sections below in order.**

## 1. Platform Access

Request access to the following platforms from your manager:

| Platform                                                | Resources                             |
|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
