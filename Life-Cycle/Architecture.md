## Context
Architecture standards used in all applications.

## Introduction
The development of modern applications has ultimately become a huge task of managing dependencies throughout the code.
A bad design though could lead the developers to struggle a lot when having to change it.
And yes, it happens all the time due to requirements updates, for some external library that got deprecated, or for any other issue.
That's why the development team is responsible for maintaining the dependencies sane.
