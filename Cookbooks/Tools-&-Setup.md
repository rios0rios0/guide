## Context
Following the `README.md` and setup guides of the projects may get them up and running.
But, the development process goes a bit further than this. It might be very painful to develop and contribute without some proper tools and configurations.
This documentation aims to give some tips on how to do that.

## OS
Most of any engineering teams use Linux. So, all the documentation is valid for this platform.
If at any moment, a dev chooses to use macOS or Windows, this place would be a good spot to leave some specific tips and help.

### Windows
* Windows Subsystem for Linux. You can follow the guide at [How to set up the WSL?]()
* Handling ssh keys on WSL2 ([Use an ssh-agent in WSL with your ssh setup from Windows 10 | by Philipp Scheit | Medium](https://pscheit.medium.com/use-an-ssh-agent-in-wsl-with-your-ssh-setup-in-windows-10-41756755993e))

## Containers
Some projects are going to use Docker and Docker Compose containers. It's good to have them installed.

* [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
